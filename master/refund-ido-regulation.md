# REFUND IDO REGULATION

The cryptocurrency market is always volatile, so Xtox announced that our Launchpad will add refund rules in IDO. This is a way to limit risks for the community when investing in IDO.



**Refund rules when participating in IDO**

After the Token is listed on the exchange, the community can make 2 choices:

ðŸ”° **Option 1:** Claim token to wallet, pay USDT to Xtox Launchpad.

With option 1, people can Claim tokens or have the tokens returned directly to the registered wallet after 1 hour - 24 hours depending on the project.

ðŸ”° **Option 2:** Refund tokens to Xtox Launchpad, receive USDT back.

With option 2, the community can receive their money back within the first 24 hours of the token being publicly listed.



This is Xtox Launchpad's policy for the IDO participating community, helping people be flexible in making investment decisions based on the market.
